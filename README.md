# Lymphography-Dataset-Neural-Network

It is an imaging technique used to proovide precise information on the lymph vessels and lymph nodes.


The Dataset has 19 columns, and teh target column is "class"
class: normal find-1
        metastatses-2
        malign lymph-2
        fibrosis-4
        
 The data set has 148 rows, without column headings
 So we need to ad the columns while loading the data in python.
 
 It is a very small dataset, and an imbalanced datset
 so we have perform sampling techinique to balance the dataset.
